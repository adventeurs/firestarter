# Kanban

Small demo project for a kanban application. Simple drag and drop boards. Create a board for your favorite books; add vocabulary words to your list and organize them by however you like. Connect to dictionary API and pull definitions as words are placed on board. Templates allow users to add page number, sentence the word appears in and more details from the word.

Browse books and find user generated vocab lists to tackle before you start your next novel.
